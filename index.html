<dl>Basic Obedience:</dl></button></a>
      <dd>Obedience training is the process of teaching dog and handler command work. You give a command, the dog complys. This includes the basics such as sit, stay, down, recall/come, loose leash walking, and heel.</dd>

   <dl>Advanced Obedience:</dl></button></a>
      <dd>The difference in the advanced and the basic is that they are a little more complicated and can take longer for different dogs to learn. This includes commands such as Fetch, place, rollover, crawl, shake, bow, and speak.</dd>

  	<dl>Problem Solving:</dl></button></a>
      <dd>Problem solving consists of modifying nuisance behaviors. Some things like stealing food and getting into garbage are not canine problems they are problems to humans. Some more examples of these problems would be, house breaking, jumping, barking, digging, chewing, counter surfing, bolting, and things of that nature.</dd>

  <dl>Behavior Modifications:</dl></button></a>
      <dd>The difference in problem solving and behavior modification is the potential for danger. These include things like resource guarding, redirected aggression, inter-species aggression, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, idiopathic anxiety, fear aggression, territorialism, and things of that nature. These behaviors can be dangerous for everyone and need to be handled carefully, by either a professional, your dogs veterinarian, or maybe even a mixture of both.</dd>
