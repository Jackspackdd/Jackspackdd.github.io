<h1>About us</h1> <p>Jack's Pack Dog Development</p>
<p> Jack's Pack Dog Development was created with one goal in mind, to help canines live a better life amongst their humans. Jack was an American bulldog born on January 29th, 2013 in Newport News, VA. I had the pleasure of growing close with him over the span of his life. He was well-loved and spoiled by his owners (and he knew it). One of whom is my best friend and although I didn't know nearly as much about dogs as I thought I did, I knew I always had a passion for dogs. Jack sadly passed away on February 21st, 2021 at the age of 8, due to health complications. He now lives on in his loved oneâ€™s hearts, including mine. When it was time for me to come up with a name for my business all I could think about was how much Jack really grew my love and passion for dogs over the years. So now, his name also lives on through this business named after him dedicated to helping canines and humans simply, enjoy living with their new human packs, as Jack did with his.  </p>

<h2>About me</h2> <p>Jack's Pack Dog Development</p>
<div> My name is Rashaad Williams. I grew up always knowing I wanted to be a veterinarian. As I got older, I started to learn that vets do more than just work with dogs; they not only work with other animals, but they also operate on animals. It was an easy decision for me to decide to take a different path. After countless hours of research, I finally found being a dog trainer to be my dream job. I not only get to work with canines all day, but I also really get to help as many of them as I can, to really have a better life. </div>
