  <p>"I highly recommend Jack's Pack Dog Development. Rashaad is a trainer who gets results. He uses positive reinforcement not shock or prong collars like some trainers. He took a dog we had in rescue for nearly a year who had trust issues and aggression. He worked with him for a few weeks and the results were amazing. He went from aggression to a loving, trusting lap furkid. Behavior modification was the issue he needed the most help with. Shelter/rescue dogs many times lose trust in humans and need extra attention to regain that trust. Adopters do not always realize they are not as trusting as a new puppy. Rashaad will be our go to trainer. If you need help with basic obidence, potty training, behavior modification or any other area of training for your dog, no matter the size, age or breed, contact Jack's Pack Dog Development. You will be pleased with the results."</p>

  <p>"I would highly recommend this company. They got my puppy at 8 weeks, before he went I had trouble with chewing, jumping on furniture and not listening to anything we were trying to teach him. My puppy was dropped off for 1 week and when I got him back I was absolutely stunned. He now listens to basic commands, walks on a leash and is potty trained. They are affordable and were a pleasure to work with.!! Mr. Williams is truly a gifted dog handler.! Thanks again for everything."</p>

  <p>"We have a 9 month aussielab and Rashad was amazing with Nala. He explained the process, showed us how to coreect behavior we don't want but also how to get her to listen and follow instructions. The written homework sheet he provided was awesome, that helped us a whole lot to remember what we needed to enforce. Rashad as an individual is a kind, educated and organized young man, Nala felt very comfortable with him. <br> I'll recommend him to anyone especially if they are 1st time dog owners, I wish we would have found him earlier."</p>

  <p>"Rashaad is one of the most patient and understanding dog trainers that I've ever had the pleasure of working beside. He came to us about a year ago and was so passionate about dogs, he had the courage to ask if my partner and I would teach him. In the past year Rashaad has always showed up on time, always picked the most difficult dogs first, and he rehabilitates them with a passion I can't put into words. Rashaad is compassionate and outstanding in the industry. I'm honored to call him my friend and fellow dog trainer, I don't doubt for one second that he can and will help any dog he meets. Thank you for being a part of our pack and following your dreams Rashaad."</p>
